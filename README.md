# TypeScript Pro Full-stack

Modern full-stack web app boilerplate template.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Runs client and server and opens `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run test` - Runs jest tests
- `npm run lint` - Runs es-lint
- `npm run build` - Builds the dist folder will include all the needed files, both client (Bundle) and server.
- `npm start` - Runs node `./dist/server/server.js`
- `npm start:prod` - sets NODE_ENV to production and then runs node `./dist/server/server.js`

## Config
And a .env file to override variable in dev environment.
